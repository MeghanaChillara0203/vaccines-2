# Schedules

This document is intended to be a list of our expected availability. Provide as much detail as is reasonable for you - we're all on very different schedules.

**Philip:** Planning to do the bulk of my coding Sunday morning or Monday evening; also happy to jump in briefly to help out with bug fixes at other times. Best to ping me on Slack.
