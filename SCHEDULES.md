# Schedules

This document is intended to be a list of our expected availability. Provide as much detail as is reasonable for you - we're all on very different schedules.

**Philip:** Planning to do the bulk of my coding Sunday morning or Monday evening; also happy to jump in briefly to help out with bug fixes at other times. Best to ping me on Slack.

**Sophia:** I am able to work on some of the planning items today (Friday), but then I won't have a lot of time to work until Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I would be good with taking on some of the later steps of the project. I usually check Slack and Discord for DMs.

**Qiwei:** I have free time on Monday afternoon and Tuesday since I have a synthesis assignment for another class need to work on during the weekend. Free to Slack me or DM me on Discord(JerryV7#7759).
